Case Study Description:
Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.
Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex your exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. They believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. Using your friends initial research, you'll delve into the Netflix data to see if you can determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors, if any.
You have been supplied with the dataset netflix_data.csv , along with the following table detailing the column names and descriptions. This data does contain null values and some outliers, but handling these is out of scope for the project.


Perform exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data to understand more about movies from the 1990s decade.
1. What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration (use 1990 as the decade's start year).
2. A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.
